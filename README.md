# Social-media

This project was build to show a demo of how a basic social media application works. At the same time helped me to gain experience in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJs an NodeJs)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

In your terminal run:

git clone https://github.com/PablooEs/social-media.git

### Prerequisites

A computer with nodeJs installed and code editor of your preferences (I use Visual Studio Code).

### Installing

Since the project runs with a backend and frontend separated you need to run npm install 3 times.

First run on the root folder of the project "social-media":

npm install

Second run on the backend folder:

npm install

And finally on the frontend folder:

npm install

To run the project go to the root folder and:

npm run dev

Clarification:

The project needs a mongoDB database for running correctly, contact the administrator for the enviroment variables.
